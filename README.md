# segment
Text segmentation.

Run like so:
```bash
python3 shell.py
```

Type a word into the shell and it will print that word segmented by its English compounds.

If you type:
```python
prob(hello)
```

Then it will return the probability of the word "hello" as it appears in frequencies.txt. You can use this for debugging, e.g.: if you see a questionable segmentation.
